			description = Small, blue, and beautiful, Cindera is a unique hot gas giant which harbors multiple fun little moons. Unfortunately for avid explorers however, being so small means itâ€™s a challenge to get to. And, as a bonus, the heat it produces is an excellent deterrence from aerobraking, or getting too close to it anyway. Bring some radiators, for your own sake.

Space weather is distinct from but conceptually related to the terrestrial weather of the atmosphere of Earth (troposphere and stratosphere). The term space weather was first used in the 1950s and came into common usage in the 1990s.
